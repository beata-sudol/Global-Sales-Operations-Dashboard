## Project Overview
This Power BI project an end-to-end sales analysis of a fictional e-commerce company using Power BI. The dashboard focuses on sales performance, target attainment, profitability and operational efficiency.

##🎯 Business Objectives
*Analyze total sales and sales trends over time.
*Evaluate sales target attainment.
*Compare performance across product categories and regions.
*Identify operational issues related to delivery time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*Power BI Desktop - Data modeling and visualization.
*Power Query (M) - Advanced ETL processes and data cleaning.
*DAX - Complex measures to business KPIs (YTD, Profit Margin %, Target Realization).
*Figma - Custom UI/UX layout and background design.

## 🧩 The "Data Cleaning" Challenge
A significant part of this project involved resolving critical data quality issues found in the raw dataset:

*Inconsistent Dates: Fixed logical errors inshipping dates by developing a custom lead-time model based on geographic regions.
*Metrics Calibration: Resolved extreme outliers in Profit Margin (initially showing 3000% due to scaling/aggregation errors) by implementing robust DAX measures and 'DIVIDE' logic.

## 📊 Key Business Insights
*Executive Summary: High-level view of Gross Revenue, Net Profit and Target Attainment.
*Geographic Revenue Distribution Identification of top-performing regions vs areas requiring logistical optimization.
*Operational Audit: Analysis of Order Volume and Average Lead Time to identify bottlenecks in the supply chain.
*Product Performance Matrix: Deep dive into sub-category profitability across different global markets.
